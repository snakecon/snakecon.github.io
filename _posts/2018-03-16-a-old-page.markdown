Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```

$$ J_\alpha(x) = \sum_{m=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^m}{m! \Gamma (m + \alpha + 1)} {\left({ \frac{x}{2} }\right)}^{2m + \alpha} \text {，独立公式示例} $$
